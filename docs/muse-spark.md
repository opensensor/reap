# Experimental Muse Spark pruning support

This adapter implements the first part of Muse Spark support: collecting pruning
statistics from materialized, unquantized eager MoEs and slicing retained experts.
It is not a complete 816B checkpoint conversion or serving pipeline.

## Implemented

- A pruning-only observer configuration for `MuseSparkForCausalLM` and
  `MuseSparkForConditionalGeneration`, including the latter's nested text model.
- Actual model router weights and selected IDs, preserving sigmoid scoring,
  selection-only correction bias, selected-score normalization, and routed scaling.
  `renormalize_router_weights` does not override Muse's native coefficients.
- Expert outputs measured **after** the shared post-expert norm and **before**
  the weighted mixture/shared output projection. Only selected expert/token pairs
  are recomputed; summaries are `[tokens, top_k]`, avoiding a dense
  `[experts, tokens, hidden]` activation allocation.
- Existing REAP statistics, including conditional-mean `reap`, contribution sum
  `weighted_ean_sum`, and selection frequency. The existing softmax observer path
  for other models is unchanged.
- Consistent slicing of both fused banks, router rows, and selection-bias entries.
  Shared norms/projections and top-k are preserved. Retained IDs are sorted into
  original order; score ties retain lower original IDs.
- Uniform in-memory model pruning/export dispatch, with all-layer coverage,
  count, top-k, and finite-saliency checks before pruning begins. Config updates
  target `text_config` for the multimodal wrapper.

The observer recomputes the routed expert outputs after the native forward; this
is a correctness-first implementation, not an optimized single-pass observer.
The per-MoE pruning utility allocates replacement banks and replaces Parameters;
it is intended for inference/export, not reuse with an existing optimizer.

## APIs

For a materialized Muse MoE and its real pre-MoE hidden states:

```python
from reap.models.muse_spark import collect_muse_pruning_metrics, prune_muse_experts
from reap.pruning_metrics import initialize_pruning_state

state = initialize_pruning_state(moe.experts.num_experts)
collect_muse_pruning_metrics(moe, hidden_states, state, valid_token_mask=padding_mask)

# REAP: state["reap"].mean
# Contribution weighting: state["weighted_ean_sum"]
# padding_mask uses True/1 for real tokens; None means all tokens are real.
# Only prune after calibration/validation; the operation changes this module.
prune_muse_experts(moe, retained_expert_ids)
```

For a model that already fits in memory and has a compatible native implementation:

```python
from reap.observer import MoETransformerObserver, MuseSparkObserverHookConfig

observer = MoETransformerObserver(model, MuseSparkObserverHookConfig())
with observer.set_attention_mask(batch.get("attention_mask")):
    model(**batch)
observations = observer.report_state()
observer.close_hooks()
```

`reap.prune.prune` accepts these observations with `PruneArgs(prune_method="reap")`
or `PruneArgs(prune_method="weighted_ean_sum")`. It currently requires observations
for every text layer and uniform expert counts. Calling `prune_muse_experts` on one
MoE updates that module's config copy; it does not update an enclosing model's config.

## Explicit limitations

Do **not** use the existing `reap.layerwise_prune` command to load the 816B model:
it materializes the whole checkpoint in host RAM before layer replay. Moreover,
its replay cache reuses first-layer attention kwargs. Muse needs per-layer
sliding/full masks and RoPE/NoPE handling. `LayerwiseMoEObserver` rejects Muse
until those semantics are implemented and tested.

The upstream dependency pins remain unchanged. Transformers 4.55 does not
provide Muse. Production loading needs a separately validated Muse-capable
Transformers environment; changing the project's global pins would also require
testing its existing model implementations, evaluation dependencies, and vLLM.
The new adapter itself imports no Muse-specific Transformers implementation.

Merging metrics, packed NVFP4/int4 weights, adaptive per-layer expert counts,
shard-streaming export, full-model generation quality, and Ascend/CANN kernels
are not supported by this change. Registering the model attributes does not
establish support for other REAP merging/conversion paths.

## Validation

```sh
PYTHONPATH=src CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='' python -m pytest -q \
  tests/test_muse_spark.py tests/test_pruning_metrics.py
```

Tests use small unquantized eager MoEs extracted from the upstream implementation,
with no model downloads or gated weights. They verify FP32/BF16 statistics against
actual native forward outputs, biased routing and scaling, padding exclusion,
invalid-input rejection, masked rerouting versus physical slicing, shared-weight
preservation, both wrapper layouts, and safetensors save/reload dispatch. The
wrapper models used for export tests are small test harnesses, not complete native
Transformers models; full `from_pretrained` reload remains a separate milestone.

The test reference is pinned to Hugging Face Transformers commit
[`d4804f9d76b8c071b993d813e9e87067b780cbee`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/d4804f9d76b8c071b993d813e9e87067b780cbee/src/transformers/models/muse_spark/modeling_muse_spark.py).
`tests/muse_reference.py` retains the Apache-2.0 notice and documents its extraction
and removal of kernel-dispatch decorators. It is not a production model loader.

## Remaining milestones

1. Read indexed safetensors by layer into a meta-initialized text model, preserve
   FP32 routers/residual gates, bound resident weights, and resume calibration
   using saved activation/score artifacts. Verify peak RSS, not just device memory.
2. Reconstruct layer-specific attention masks and positional embeddings, preserve
   the original padding mask for statistics, and compare multi-layer replay with
   native full forwards on a small Muse model, including contexts past the sliding
   window. Keep vision/audio blocks out of text calibration discovery.
3. Calibrate all 62 layers on representative coding data; compare REAP and
   contribution weighting using held-out loss/logit drift and executable coding
   tasks. Near-constant post-normalization expert norms mean REAP may closely
   track conditional average routing weight on Muse.
4. Stream a separate pruned checkpoint with tensor slicing, index/config updates,
   retained-ID provenance, interrupted-run handling, and native reload parity.
5. Evaluate W4 quantization and the Ascend backend independently. Pruning quality,
   quantization quality, simulator parity, and actual device allocation/throughput
   are separate checks. Keeping top-8 does not halve active expert computation.
